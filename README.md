Hello!
I'm Candice, an interaction designer working @ Microsoft. This is my second year in HCDE. I studied CS initially and then transfer to design major in my bachelor. Since I'm interested in product design, I would like to improve my understanding about 3D form designs and prototyping through this class. I can teach my peers on how to use illustrator and help debugging when there is a web programming issues.
